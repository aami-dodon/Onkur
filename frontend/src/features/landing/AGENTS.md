# Landing Experience Guidelines

These notes apply to files within `frontend/src/features/landing/`.

- Keep role journey copy centralized in `JourneyDetailsPage.jsx` so the landing cards and details stay in sync.
- Prefer expressive, human-centered language that reflects Onkur's community tone when editing marketing content.
- When adding new public routes, update `App.jsx` and ensure there is a clear call-to-action guiding visitors to `/signup` or `/login`.
