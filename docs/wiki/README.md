## Project conventions
- **Backend features** live in `backend/src/features/<feature-name>/`. Each HTTP surface area exports an Express router from a file that ends with `.route.js`. The auto-loader in `backend/src/routes/index.js` mounts routers automatically using the optional `basePath` export.
- **Frontend features** live in `frontend/src/features/<feature-name>/`. Build components that encapsulate view + data fetching logic and import them into `App.jsx` or your routing layer.
- **Shared utilities** belong in `backend/src/utils/` or `backend/src/features/common/` to keep core bootstrapping files unchanged for future updates.
- **Configuration** is centralized under `backend/src/config/` and `.env` files. Add new variables to `backend/.env.example` and document them in this wiki or the README.

## Environment setup
1. Install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) which ships with npm.
2. Provision PostgreSQL and MinIO instances. Locally you can reuse Docker Hub images such as `postgres:16` and `minio/minio`.
3. Copy environment templates and adjust them to match your infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```
4. Update **backend** `.env` with values for `DATABASE_URL`, `MINIO_*`, `PORT`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `LOG_LEVEL`, and optional `LOG_FILE`.
5. Update **frontend** `.env` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL` that points to your backend (for example `http://localhost:5000`).

## Local development workflow
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   (cd backend && npm install)
   (cd frontend && npm install)
   ```
2. **Smoke test infrastructure (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run test:connections   # runs test:db and test:minio sequentially
   ```
   These scripts hit PostgreSQL and MinIO using the connection information from `.env` and log through the shared Winston logger.
3. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev               # starts nodemon on src/server.js
   ```
4. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Vite serves the React app at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API calls to the backend defined in `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## End-to-end example: Notes feature
Follow this walkthrough to add a simple "notes" feature spanning both the API and the React client. It demonstrates how the folder structure keeps changes scoped to feature modules.

### 1. Prepare the database
Create a `notes` table with a few sample rows in PostgreSQL. From a `psql` session connected to your database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO notes (title, body)
VALUES
  ('First note', 'Rendered from the new template walkthrough.'),
  ('Second note', 'Feel free to remove these once your own data exists.');
```

### 2. Backend feature module
1. Create a new folder: `backend/src/features/notes/`.
2. Inside it, add `notes.route.js` with the following router (the auto-loader will mount it at `/api/notes` because of the `basePath` export):
   ```js
   const express = require("express");
   const pool = require("../common/db");
   const logger = require("../../utils/logger");

   const router = express.Router();

   router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const result = await pool.query("SELECT id, title, body FROM notes ORDER BY id ASC");
       logger.info("Fetched notes", { count: result.rowCount });
       res.json(result.rows);
     } catch (error) {
       logger.error("Failed to fetch notes", { error: error.message });
       res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to load notes" });
     }
   });

   module.exports = {
     basePath: "/api/notes",
     router,
   };
   ```
3. Restart the backend dev server if it was running. You should see a log similar to `Registered router from notes/notes.route.js at base path '/api/notes'.`
4. Validate the API by calling it directly:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/notes
   ```
   The response should be the seed rows you inserted earlier.

### 3. Frontend feature module
1. Create `frontend/src/features/notes/NotesList.jsx`:
   ```jsx
   import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL;

   export default function NotesList() {
     const [notes, setNotes] = useState([]);
     const [error, setError] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/notes`)
         .then((res) => {
           if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`Request failed: ${res.status}`);
           return res.json();
         })
         .then(setNotes)
         .catch(setError);
     }, []);

     if (error) {
       return <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>Unable to load notes: {error.message}</p>;
     }

     return (
       <section>
         <h2>Notes</h2>
         <ul>
           {notes.map((note) => (
             <li key={note.id}>
               <strong>{note.title}</strong>
               <p>{note.body}</p>
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
2. Import the component inside `frontend/src/App.jsx` alongside the existing `HealthCheck` widget:
   ```jsx
   import NotesList from './features/notes/NotesList';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div style={{ fontFamily: 'sans-serif', padding: 32 }}>
         <h1>PERN Frontend</h1>
         <HealthCheck />
         <NotesList />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
3. With both dev servers running, visit `http://localhost:5173` and confirm the Notes list renders beneath the health check block.

### 4. Production readiness checks
- Run `npm run build` inside `frontend/` to ensure the new UI compiles.
- Consider adding automated tests (e.g. Jest for backend, Vitest/React Testing Library for frontend) once the feature grows.

## Docker usage
You can spin up both servers with Docker once your `.env` files are configured:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
- The backend listens on `http://localhost:5001` (mapped from container port `5000`).
- The frontend listens on `http://localhost:3000` (mapped from container port `5173`).
- Hot reloading is enabled by mounting the repository into each container.

## Troubleshooting checklist
- **Missing routers?** Ensure the file ends with `.route.js` and exports either the router directly or an object with `{ router, basePath }`.
- **CORS issues?** Confirm `CORS_ORIGIN` in `backend/.env` matches the frontend origin (for Vite dev this is usually `http://localhost:5173`).
- **Connection errors?** Run `npm run test:db` and `npm run test:minio` for quick diagnostics and double-check credentials.
- **Frontend cannot reach backend?** Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points at the backend port (use `http://localhost:5000` when running both locally outside Docker, or `http://localhost:5001` when using `docker compose`).

Happy building! ðŸŽ‰
