## Phase 1 â€“ Foundation

### Highlights
- Email + password authentication with mandatory email verification, JWT session tokens, and secure logout revocation.
- Role-based access controls for **Volunteer**, **Event Manager**, **Sponsor**, and **Admin** with dedicated dashboard shells.
- Mobile-first layout with the earthy green palette, sticky bottom navigation, and welcoming auth flows.
- Admin operations center to assign roles and review the active community directory.

### Backend services
- **Data models**
  - `users`: `id (UUID)`, `name`, `email`, `email_normalized`, `password_hash`, `role`, `created_at`, `email_verified_at`.
  - `audit_logs`: `id`, `actor_id`, `action`, `metadata (JSONB)`, `created_at`.
  - `revoked_tokens`: `id`, `jti`, `expires_at` (used to invalidate JWTs during logout).
  - `email_verification_tokens`: `id`, `user_id`, `token`, `expires_at`, `used_at`, `created_at`.
- **Authentication pipeline**
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (`BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS` configurable).
  - Signup queues an email verification token and requires confirmation before login succeeds.
  - JWTs signed with `JWT_SECRET`, include `sub`, `role`, and `jti` claims, and expire per `JWT_EXPIRY`.
  - Logout revokes the token `jti` server-side to prevent reuse.
- **API surface** (all routes prefixed with `/api`)
  - `POST /auth/signup` â€“ create a volunteer account, send the verification email, and return `{ user, requiresEmailVerification, message }`.
  - `POST /auth/login` â€“ authenticate existing users and return the same payload shape as signup once verified.
  - `POST /auth/logout` â€“ revoke the active token (Authorization bearer required).
  - `POST /auth/verify-email` â€“ confirm a verification token and unlock login.
  - `GET /me` â€“ fetch the profile for the authenticated caller.
  - `GET /users` â€“ admin-only directory of all accounts.
  - `PATCH /users/:id/role` â€“ admin-only role reassignment.
  - `GET /auth/roles` â€“ public list of supported roles for UI pickers.
- **Audit logging** records `auth.signup`, `auth.login.success`, `auth.login.failure`, `auth.logout`, and `auth.role.change` events for traceability.

### Frontend experience
- Global **AuthProvider** wraps the app, persists JWT metadata in `localStorage`, and refreshes the profile via `/api/me` on load.
- **Auth screens** mirror the warm Onkur tone with stacked fields, clear copy, and cross-links between login and signup.
- **Dashboards**
  - Volunteer: impact tracker placeholders, upcoming commitments, and storytelling guidance.
  - Event Manager: pipeline, volunteer coordination, and gallery management stubs.
  - Sponsor: sponsorship visibility, recognition toolkit, and impact report shells.
  - Admin: authentication metrics snapshot, role assignment form, and community directory table.
- **Layout**
  - Sticky bottom navigation (Home, Events, Gallery, Profile) optimized for touch devices.
  - Verdant header featuring the Onkur brand, user badge, and quick logout.

### Metrics & auditing
- The admin dashboard surfaces day-zero placeholders for signups, login success, and error ratesâ€”future phases will wire real analytics to these cards.
- Audit logs capture every auth transition so we can derive signups/day, login success vs. failure, and auth error rates downstream.

### Environment keys
- Backend (`backend/.env.example`)
  - `DATABASE_URL` â€“ Postgres connection string.
  - `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRY`, `JWT_ISSUER` â€“ JWT configuration.
  - `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS` â€“ hashing cost factor.
  - `APP_BASE_URL` â€“ canonical frontend URL used in transactional emails.
  - `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_SMTP_SECURE`, `EMAIL_SMTP_USER`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PASS` â€“ SMTP credentials for transactional email.
  - `CORS_ORIGIN`, `PORT`, logging, and MinIO fields remain from the template.
- Frontend (`frontend/.env.example`)
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` â€“ origin for API requests (defaults to `http://localhost:5000`).

## Project conventions
- **Backend features** live in `backend/src/features/<feature-name>/`. Each HTTP surface area exports an Express router from a file that ends with `.route.js`. The auto-loader in `backend/src/routes/index.js` mounts routers automatically using the optional `basePath` export.
- **Frontend features** live in `frontend/src/features/<feature-name>/`. Build components that encapsulate view + data fetching logic and import them into `App.jsx` or your routing layer.
- **Shared utilities** belong in `backend/src/utils/` or `backend/src/features/common/` to keep core bootstrapping files unchanged for future updates.
- **Configuration** is centralized under `backend/src/config/` and `.env` files. Add new variables to `backend/.env.example` and document them in this wiki or the README.

## Environment setup
1. Install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) which ships with npm.
2. Provision PostgreSQL and MinIO instances. Locally you can reuse Docker Hub images such as `postgres:16` and `minio/minio`.
3. Copy environment templates and adjust them to match your infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```
4. Update **backend** `.env` with values for `DATABASE_URL`, `MINIO_*`, `PORT`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `LOG_LEVEL`, and optional `LOG_FILE`.
5. Update **frontend** `.env` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL` that points to your backend (for example `http://localhost:5000`).

## Local development workflow
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   (cd backend && npm install)
   (cd frontend && npm install)
   ```
2. **Smoke test infrastructure (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run test:connections   # runs test:db and test:minio sequentially
   ```
   These scripts hit PostgreSQL and MinIO using the connection information from `.env` and log through the shared Winston logger.
3. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev               # starts nodemon on src/server.js
   ```
4. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Vite serves the React app at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API calls to the backend defined in `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## End-to-end example: Notes feature
Follow this walkthrough to add a simple "notes" feature spanning both the API and the React client. It demonstrates how the folder structure keeps changes scoped to feature modules.

### 1. Prepare the database
Create a `notes` table with a few sample rows in PostgreSQL. From a `psql` session connected to your database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO notes (title, body)
VALUES
  ('First note', 'Rendered from the new template walkthrough.'),
  ('Second note', 'Feel free to remove these once your own data exists.');
```

### 2. Backend feature module
1. Create a new folder: `backend/src/features/notes/`.
2. Inside it, add `notes.route.js` with the following router (the auto-loader will mount it at `/api/notes` because of the `basePath` export):
   ```js
   const express = require("express");
   const pool = require("../common/db");
   const logger = require("../../utils/logger");

   const router = express.Router();

   router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const result = await pool.query("SELECT id, title, body FROM notes ORDER BY id ASC");
       logger.info("Fetched notes", { count: result.rowCount });
       res.json(result.rows);
     } catch (error) {
       logger.error("Failed to fetch notes", { error: error.message });
       res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to load notes" });
     }
   });

   module.exports = {
     basePath: "/api/notes",
     router,
   };
   ```
3. Restart the backend dev server if it was running. You should see a log similar to `Registered router from notes/notes.route.js at base path '/api/notes'.`
4. Validate the API by calling it directly:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/notes
   ```
   The response should be the seed rows you inserted earlier.

### 3. Frontend feature module
1. Create `frontend/src/features/notes/NotesList.jsx`:
   ```jsx
   import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL;

   export default function NotesList() {
     const [notes, setNotes] = useState([]);
     const [error, setError] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/notes`)
         .then((res) => {
           if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`Request failed: ${res.status}`);
           return res.json();
         })
         .then(setNotes)
         .catch(setError);
     }, []);

     if (error) {
       return <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>Unable to load notes: {error.message}</p>;
     }

     return (
       <section>
         <h2>Notes</h2>
         <ul>
           {notes.map((note) => (
             <li key={note.id}>
               <strong>{note.title}</strong>
               <p>{note.body}</p>
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
2. Import the component inside `frontend/src/App.jsx` alongside the existing `HealthCheck` widget:
   ```jsx
   import NotesList from './features/notes/NotesList';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div style={{ fontFamily: 'sans-serif', padding: 32 }}>
         <h1>PERN Frontend</h1>
         <HealthCheck />
         <NotesList />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
3. With both dev servers running, visit `http://localhost:5173` and confirm the Notes list renders beneath the health check block.

### 4. Production readiness checks
- Run `npm run build` inside `frontend/` to ensure the new UI compiles.
- Consider adding automated tests (e.g. Jest for backend, Vitest/React Testing Library for frontend) once the feature grows.

## Phase 2 â€“ Volunteer Journey

### Phase 2 Highlights
- Volunteers can create and update skill, interest, availability, and location details from the in-app profile editor.
- Published events can be browsed with filters for category, location, theme, and date while respecting capacity and duplicate signup rules.
- Signups trigger templated confirmation emails and schedule a 24-hour reminder as events approach.
- Volunteers log minutes per event, unlocking Seedling (10h), Grove Guardian (50h), and Forest Champion (100h) eco badges.
- The refreshed dashboard surfaces upcoming activities, recent participation, and impact metrics in a mobile-first layout.

### Backend APIs
- `GET /api/me/profile` and `PUT /api/me/profile` manage volunteer profile data.
- `GET /api/events` lists published events with filter support and registration status.
- `POST /api/events/:id/signup` enforces capacity, prevents duplicates, and records participation.
- `GET /api/me/signups` returns the volunteerâ€™s event commitments.
- `POST /api/events/:id/hours` logs minutes against an event signup.
- `GET /api/me/hours` aggregates totals, entries, and badge progress.
- `GET /api/me/dashboard` combines profile, activity, and achievement data for the volunteer home view.

### Data model updates
- `volunteer_profiles` stores normalized arrays for skills and interests plus availability, location, and bio metadata.
- `events` gains support for themes, status management, and timestamp columns to drive discovery and reminders.
- `event_signups` tracks reminder delivery times alongside capacity-safe registration rows.
- `volunteer_hours` records minutes, notes, and optional verification metadata per volunteer/event pairing.

### Email flows
- Signup confirmations use the shared Nodemailer transport; the scheduler (15-minute interval) sends reminders exactly 24 hours before event start.
- Reminder dispatch respects `NODE_ENV=test` to remain inert inside Jest.

### Phase 2 Frontend Experience
- The volunteer dashboard now loads profile, signups, hours, badges, and events in one pass with optimistic refresh helpers.
- Profile editing, event discovery, and hours logging components surface inline success/error states and mobile-first forms.
- Badges and recent hour entries visualize progress using the earthy Onkur palette.

### Testing & observability
- Added `volunteerJourney.service.test.js` powered by `pg-mem` to cover profile updates, event signup constraints, and badge unlock logic.
- Reminder scheduling and email dispatch leverage shared logger hooks for auditing outcomes.
- Run `npm test` inside `backend/` and `npm run build` inside `frontend/` to confirm volunteer flows and UI bundles stay health
  y after changes.

## Docker usage
You can spin up both servers with Docker once your `.env` files are configured:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
- The backend listens on `http://localhost:5001` (mapped from container port `5000`).
- The frontend listens on `http://localhost:3000` (mapped from container port `5173`).
- Hot reloading is enabled by mounting the repository into each container.

## Troubleshooting checklist
- **Missing routers?** Ensure the file ends with `.route.js` and exports either the router directly or an object with `{ router, basePath }`.
- **CORS issues?** Confirm `CORS_ORIGIN` in `backend/.env` matches the frontend origin (for Vite dev this is usually `http://localhost:5173`).
- **Connection errors?** Run `npm run test:db` and `npm run test:minio` for quick diagnostics and double-check credentials.
- **Frontend cannot reach backend?** Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points at the backend port (use `http://localhost:5000` when running both locally outside Docker, or `http://localhost:5001` when using `docker compose`).

Happy building! ðŸŽ‰
