# Onkur Change Log

## Volunteer dashboard API routing fix
- **Date:** 2025-09-18
- **Change:** Updated the volunteer journey router to register its endpoints relative to the `/api` base path so that dashboard requests such as `/api/me/dashboard` resolve correctly after login.
- **Impact:** Volunteers can now load their dashboard without receiving the generic "Request failed" error because the routes map to the expected URLs.

## Phase 3 event manager workflows
- **Date:** 2025-09-19
- **Change:** Introduced a dedicated event management feature set: managers can draft, update, publish, and complete events; define task boards; assign registered volunteers; process attendance with automatic hour logging; and generate shareable CSV impact reports. The frontend dashboard now surfaces a full workspace for these flows.
- **Impact:** Event managers can coordinate end-to-end logistics from the dashboard while volunteers immediately see published events, their assignments, and updated hours when checked in on site.

## README roadmap refresh
- **Date:** 2025-09-20
- **Change:** Expanded the public README to reflect the completed three-phase rollout, covering volunteer profiles, discovery, event management, and supporting tooling while pointing to the canonical wiki file.
- **Impact:** Stakeholders and contributors now have an at-a-glance summary of Onkur's Phase 1â€“3 capabilities without diving into internal docs.
