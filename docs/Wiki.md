## Volunteer dashboard API routing fix
- **Date:** 2025-09-18
- **Change:** Updated the volunteer journey router to register its endpoints relative to the `/api` base path so that dashboard requests such as `/api/me/dashboard` resolve correctly after login.
- **Impact:** Volunteers can now load their dashboard without receiving the generic "Request failed" error because the routes map to the expected URLs.
